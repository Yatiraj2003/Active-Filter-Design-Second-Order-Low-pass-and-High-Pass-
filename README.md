# Active-Filter-Design-Second-Order-Low-pass-and-High-Pass-
• Firstly, we have discovered the universal active filter / state variable filter 
  in the textbooks and some research papers. We have thoroughly read the 
  construction and working of that universal filter. 
  
• Next, we have simulated and verified the working of the universal filter 
  using Ideal Operational amplifiers in the cadence virtuoso tool. 
  
• Then We have designed the Two stage differential amplifier with certain 
  specifications and verified the working of that amplifier in cadence tool, 
  that is its giving correct gain and bandwidth that is required. 
  
• Finally, we have replaced the Ideal operational amplifier with two stage 
  differential amplifier and simulated the working of that overall circuit, as a 
  result we got the all-filter responses (low, high and band pass).
